Title: The Magical Paintbrush
Riya was a kind little girl who loved to paint. One day, she found a magical paintbrush in the forest. When she painted with it, everything she drew became real! She painted a house for a poor man, food for the hungry, and toys for lonely children.
One day, a greedy king heard about her magic and demanded she paint gold for him. But Riya was cleverâ€”she painted a cage around the king! She told him, 'Magic is meant to help, not for greed.'
The king learned his lesson and promised to be kind. Riya then used her brush to paint happiness for everyone.
Moral: Kindness and wisdom are more powerful than greed.
